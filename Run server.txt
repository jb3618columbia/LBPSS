How to run things on a cluster:

- In terminal do: ssh jalaj@border1.ieor.columbia.edu
- Enter the right directory
- Command: ./runmatlab.sh filename.m output.txt

Output file gives the outputs displayed on the Matlab console.

ps - jobs running on current session
ps -u jalaj: To see the all the jobs running, even after closing the terminal session

- command + K to edit using cyberduck in the server.
